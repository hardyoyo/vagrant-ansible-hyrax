# Vagrant-Ansible-Hyrax

A simplistic Vagrant dev environment for hacking on Hyrax, and do so with Ansible for provisioning. Uses [Librarian-Ansible](https://github.com/bcoe/librarian-ansible) to handle downloading Ansible roles.

Need more roles? Add them to the Ansiblefile.

This is totally a work in progress, use at your own risk.
